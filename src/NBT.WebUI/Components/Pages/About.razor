            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <FluentDivider />
            <p>
                The National Benchmark Tests (NBTs) are a set of tests that measure an applicant's academic readiness 
                for university-level education. The tests were implemented in 2009 and are managed by the Centre for 
                Educational Testing for Access and Placement (CETAP) at the University of Cape Town.
            </p>
            <p>
                The NBTs complement and support the National Senior Certificate (NSC) as predictor of academic performance. 
                They assess entry-level literacy and numeracy skills in an academic context, providing valuable information 
                about individual academic strengths and challenges.
