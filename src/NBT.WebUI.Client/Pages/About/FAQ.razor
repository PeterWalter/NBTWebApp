            <FluentAccordionItem Heading="What are the NBTs?">
                <p>
                    The National Benchmark Tests (NBTs) are assessments for first-year applicants into higher education institutions. 
                    They measure your ability to transfer understanding of Academic Literacy, Quantitative Literacy and Mathematics 
                    to the demands of tertiary coursework.
                </p>
            </FluentAccordionItem>

            <FluentAccordionItem Heading="Who should write the NBTs?">
                <p>
                    The NBTs are intended for students applying to South African universities. Many institutions require 
                    or recommend NBT results as part of their admission process. Check with your chosen institution(s) 
                    to determine if NBTs are required.
                </p>
            </FluentAccordionItem>

            <FluentAccordionItem Heading="When should I write the NBTs?">
                <p>
                    It's recommended to write the NBTs in your final year of school (Grade 12) or earlier. 
                    Tests are available throughout the year, but booking early is advised as venues fill up quickly. 
                    Remember that bookings open from April 1st each year.
                </p>
            </FluentAccordionItem>

            <FluentAccordionItem Heading="How many times can I write the NBTs?">
                <p>
                    You can write a maximum of 2 tests per year. NBT results are valid for 3 years from the date of booking. 
                    You can only book one test at a time, and can only book another test after the closing date of your 
                    current booking has passed.
                </p>
            </FluentAccordionItem>

            <FluentAccordionItem Heading="Can I register without a South African ID?">
                <p>
                    Yes! Applicants without a South African ID can register using a Foreign ID or Passport ID. 
                    The system accommodates international students and non-South African residents.
                </p>
            </FluentAccordionItem>

            <FluentAccordionItem Heading="What if I interrupt my registration?">
                <p>
                    If your registration process is interrupted for any reason, you can return and continue from where 
                    you left off. Your progress is saved automatically, so you won't need to redo completed steps.
                </p>
            </FluentAccordionItem>

            <FluentAccordionItem Heading="How much do the tests cost?">

                    cost R270. You can pay in installments until the booking closing date.

            </FluentAccordionItem>

            <FluentAccordionItem Heading="How do I pay for the test?">
                <p>
                    You can pay online via the EasyPay payment gateway (credit/debit card) or through bank transfer. 
                    Payment can be made in installments, but must be completed before the booking closing date. 
                    Only fully paid tests can be written.

            <FluentAccordionItem Heading="What if I need special accommodations?">
                <p>
                    Students requiring special accommodations (e.g., extra time, assistive technology, or specific 
                    accessibility needs) should complete the special needs form during registration. The NBT team 
                    will work with you to arrange appropriate testing conditions.

                    Remote or special sessions are arranged for groups or individuals who cannot attend regular venue 
                    sessions. These require an approved invigilator and venue details. Complete the special session 
                    form during registration, and it will be routed to the NBT remote administration team.

                    Yes! Online tests are available on specific dates throughout the year. You can write from anywhere 
                    in the world as long as you have a computer with video, sound, and internet connection. Online test 
                    dates are marked in the test calendar.

                    Results are typically released 2-3 weeks after the test date. You will receive an email notification 
                    when your results are available. You can view and download your results through your student account.

            <FluentAccordionItem Heading="Can I view my results if I haven't paid in full?">
                <p>
                    Students can only view and download fully paid test results. However, staff and administrators can 
                    view all test results regardless of payment status for administrative purposes.

                <p>
                    Each test result includes a unique barcode that distinguishes which specific test/answer sheet was used. 
                    If you write multiple tests, each will have a different barcode for verification purposes.
                </p>

                    for each domain (AL, QL, MAT). These indicate your readiness for tertiary study. Visit the 
                    "Understanding Results" page for detailed explanations.
